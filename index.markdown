Ciao! I am a PhD candidate in Surgical Robotics at UNSW, Sydney. My research interests are Soft Robotics, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and MPC, and their application to surgical robotics.

Before reaching Australia I was living in Rome, Italy, the city where I was born. 
Here I worked as a Robotics Software Engineer at Medlogix to implement autonomous robotics systems in the hyperthermia treatment for fighting cancer with technology. 

I have a Master's degree in Control & Robotics Engineering and a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering both from Sapienza University of Rome.
